# Where to go to have a University Tour

## Introduction

#### Let's say that the government want to build a new university in your hometown, but the government has no experience on this, so Professor Li are assigned to do a research about the layout of a campus. As we all know there are many famous universities in the United States, so that is where he want to do your research. To start with, he chose 5 major cities in America, which are New York,NY, San Francisco, CA, Jersey City, NJ, Boston, MA and Chicago,IL. He now wants to know, which city is his best choice. There should be as many universities as possible in the city, and the distances between them should be as neglectable as possible, so that he can save his time on the way.

## Dataset

#### I will use the FourSquare API to collect data about locations of Universities in 5 major US cities which are: New York,NY, San Francisco, CA, Jersey City, NJ, Boston, MA and Chicago,IL. Of course there are also many other places in the US which have the most old and glorious colleges, but the purpose is to find the layout of the campus. So it could be better to collect some ideas from the mordern Universities. The cities chosen are metropolis in the  US and I am hopeful that Professor Li will get satisfied to get his  research done here.
